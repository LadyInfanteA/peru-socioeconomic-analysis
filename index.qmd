# Introduction

The topic was chosen because it allows for an indepth exploration of socioeconomic dynamics in urban Peru. The analysis relies on data provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI, National Institute of Statistics and Informatics of Peru), which offers comprehensive coverage of the country's demographic, economic, and social indicators. This rich dataset enables a better understanding of the development of Peru. For the scope of this data project, the focus has been on the Lima metropolitan area, which represents approximately one-third of the total population. This area was selected because many market research firms make socioeconomic information for its districts publicly available, and the completeness and reliability of data in this area are higher compared to other ones.
