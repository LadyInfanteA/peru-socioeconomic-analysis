# Conclusion

The results show that proximity to wealth in Lima Metropolitan Area has a dual and uneven effect on the poor. Living near wealthy districts offers some measurable benefits, such as better infrastructure thanks to indirect investment and higher housing values, but it also amplifies key vulnerabilities. Poor households in mixed areas face worse water service, higher effective water costs, and stronger reliance on coping strategies than those in uniformly poor areas.

In summary, living near wealth can both help and hurt the poor: it improves their physical environment, but at the same time intensifies economic burdens and inequalities in services at neighborhood boundaries.

A key limitation we faced was the difficulty of identifying socioeconomic levels outside Lima Metropolitan Area, as these areas are not prioritized in commercial market studies. However, this information could be reconstructed using census data by recreating the classification scale for socioeconomic levels (A, B, C, D, E). Expanding this reconstruction would allow the analysis to be replicated at the national level, where the inequalities observed here would likely become even more pronounced.

Overall, this project allowed us to explore relationships between variables that are rarely examined together, while avoiding the loss of important information due to missing values. Instead of discarding variables with high rate of missing values, we used grouped indicators to preserve underlying content and uncover meaningful patterns.
